# Exchange-RS

A high-performance limit order book implementation in Rust, designed for low-latency trading systems. This implementation focuses on efficiency, thread safety, and maintaining a clean, modular architecture.

## Features

- Highly efficient limit order book implementation
- Support for various order types:
  - Market orders
  - Limit orders
  - Stop orders (stop-market and stop-limit)
  - Iceberg orders
- Time-in-force options (GTC, IOC, FOK, GTD)
- Thread-safe concurrent order book implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Order Book (`orderbook.rs`)**
   - Maintains buy and sell side price levels
   - Handles order management and matching
   - Implements price-time priority
   - Supports stop order book functionality
   - Thread-safe implementation available via `ConcurrentOrderBook`

2. **Matching Engine (`matching_engine.rs`)**
   - Processes incoming orders
   - Manages multiple order books
   - Handles trade execution and order lifecycle
   - Supports various order types and time-in-force options

3. **Order Management (`order.rs`)**
   - Defines order types and states
   - Handles order validation and status updates
   - Supports advanced order features (stop prices, display quantities)

### Design Principles

1. **Performance First**
   - Lock-free data structures where possible
   - Minimized memory allocations
   - Efficient price level management
   - Cache-friendly data structures

2. **Thread Safety**
   - Careful lock management using `parking_lot`
   - Thread-safe concurrent implementations
   - Lock-free operations where possible

3. **Memory Safety**
   - Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety
   - Reference counting (`Arc`) for shared ownership
   - Smart pointer usage for thread-safe access

4. **Modularity**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined interfaces between components
   - Easy to extend and modify

## Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- Price level caching
- Smart pointer usage optimization
- Efficient order matching algorithms
- Lock-free concurrent data structures
- Cache-padded data structures for concurrent access

### Memory Management
- Pre-allocated order pools
- Efficient order cancellation
- Smart cleanup of empty price levels
- Minimal cloning of data

## Testing

The project includes extensive test coverage across different components:

### Unit Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory:
- `orderbook_tests.rs` - Tests for order book functionality
- `order_tests.rs` - Tests for order management
- `matching_engine_tests.rs` - Tests for order matching logic

### Benchmarks
```bash
cargo bench
```

Performance benchmarks are in the `benches/` directory:
- `benchmark.rs` - General performance benchmarks
- `concurrent_benchmarks.rs` - Multi-threaded performance tests
- `matching_engine_benchmarks.rs` - Order matching performance
- `order_benchmarks.rs` - Order processing performance

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

For optimal performance, always use release builds in production.

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Implement SIMD operations for bulk order processing
   - Further optimize memory allocation patterns
   - Investigate zero-copy deserialization
   - Implement order book snapshots for faster recovery

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Add support for more order types (e.g., OCO, trailing stops)
   - Implement market maker protections
   - Add support for auction periods
   - Implement circuit breakers

3. **Observability**
   - Add comprehensive metrics collection
   - Implement order book depth tracking
   - Add support for market data snapshots
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring

4. **Scalability**
